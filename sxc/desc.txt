NAME

    sxc - Simple Xmpp Client

DESCRIPTION

    sxc (pronounced "sexy") is for jabber what ii (irc it/irc improved) is for
    IRC: A minimalistic file-based jabber client which runs in the background
    and can be controlled with basic command line tools to read from/write
    into the files/FIFOs sxc creates.

TECHNICAL STUFF

    sxc will be written in C++ and will run on any POSIX compatible platform.
    Each instance of sxc logs in into exactly one account. It creates an
    account directory containing directories for contacts, an information
    directory (nfo/), a FIFO file (in) and a normal file (out). Each contact is
    represented by a directory that is named after the contact's Jabber-ID and
    contains, just like the account directory, a FIFO file (in), a normal file
    (out) and an information directoy (nfo/).

    You can communicate with sxc, the server (e.g. add a contact or change your
    presence status) by writing into the account's in-FIFO. Server messages
    will be written to the account's out-file. Messages are sent by writing
    into the contact's in-file, responses can be read by reading the contents
    of the contact's out-file. The presence state can be changed by writing
    into the account's in-file. The nfo/ directories will contain information
    about current presence state, whether a contact has been added to your
    buddy list and so on.

    Since this directory tree is similar to the one of ii (except the
    additional nfo/ directory and the missing in-FIFOs in ii's query
    directories) it's easy to write interfaces/bots that support both programs.
    They can even be written as a shell script!

EXAMPLES

    echo "this is a message" > joe@example.org/john@example.org/in
    echo "/status away" > joe@example.org/in
    cat joe@example.org/john@example.org/out
    cat joe@example.org/john@example.org/nfo/status
