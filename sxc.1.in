    echo "\\0:set available\\0" > $JID/in
)&
exec src/@PACKAGE@ $JID

.SH BUGS
When multiple processes write to the input file at the same time they cannot be
distinguished and get interpreted as a single command. Circumvent this by
surrounding your input with nullstrings (\\0). This is especially important
with :pwd, as for example a :msg or :set, that have been called before, could make your
password public.
.PP
A proxy cannot be set directly. Instead use a transparent proxying library like
.B tsocks(1)
to make
.B @PACKAGE@
use a proxy.
.PP
.B @PACKAGE@
announces to the server to be a "console" program, but this highly depends on
your usage of sxc. A "client daemon" would maybe be more appropriate.
.PP
Chat states - whether a contact is active, composing a message, paused,
inactive, or gone - are not supported at all. No one can see yours, and you
cannot see anybody's. The first is because of the file-based design of sxc, the
second because we don't like chat states. Please fork or write a patch if you
would like to have this feature, we are absolutely not going to include it.
.PP
If you are disconnected from the server, but sxc is still running, the in-files
of the contacts are not connected to sxc. Therefore they will just block until
you establish a new connection.
.PP
You cannot exit
.B @PACKAGE@
from within. Use
.B kill(1)
instead to send a
.B SIGTERM.
If you are running
.B @PACKAGE@
in the foreground of a shell you can probably (depending on your shell) send a
.B SIGINT
to terminate the program using CTRL+C.
