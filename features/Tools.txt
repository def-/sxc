% sxc-reg user@example.org

- Seperate C++ program that may be enabled/disabled at compile time.
- Tries to register an account, reports success or that registering did not
  work (and possibly why).
- After being launched, it validates the command line arguments and then asks
  the user for a password. Then, the registration progress is initiated using
  the gloox library which is already part of sxc.
